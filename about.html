    <p>Ebay sells every item we can imagine, and more. The Ebay Catalogue is a collection of items for sale that are unimaginable, the weird shit you just have never thought of. Click the item you are interested to go to the auction page.</p>

    <p> Looking at the items and their prices, I have reassessed my values, since I have never been so confused. I am no longer sure if I will update the catalogue and include new items once in a while, as I initially planned, becuase the more I found, the more I am dissapointed by this society.</p>
